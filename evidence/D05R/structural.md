# D5R structural verifications

Each entry records a structural task's exact verification (D5R breakdown, section 5), and each task ends with a complete cumulative suite run delegated to the `suite-runner` subagent, with full outputs in `suite-runs/`. Versions are in [provenance.md](provenance.md). Each task's `ocr-review` findings and bug tasks are recorded under the task's heading, with the raw outputs in `ocr/`.

## Start of D5R

Location checks (D5R handoff, section 1) all matched on 2026-10-31: worktree and branch `claude-opus-5.5`, `ahead 11`, clean; `git log claude-opus-5.5-pre-d5r..HEAD` empty; tags `claude-opus-5.5-plan-r20`, `claude-opus-5.5-d5` and `claude-opus-5.5-pre-d5r` present; `claude-opus-5.5-d5` is `fbe3bb71dcc7114e7f0568272be48f0412cfeab8`; `DEV_PORT=5175`; Node v26.12.0. `npm ci` exit 0. `npx vitest run src`: `Test Files 69 passed (69)`, `Tests 893 passed (893)`. `npx vitest run tests/integration`: `Test Files 53 passed (53)`, `Tests 105 passed (105)`.

Spec reading: `plan/spec-reading/D05.md` in full, plus AC-MARK-004 (`specs/acceptance/acceptance-contract.md` lines 289–295, spec map S047), as the handoff directs. No other spec section has been needed yet.

## Setup: tdd.sh accepts T5R task IDs

Change in `.claude/scripts/tdd.sh`: the task-ID pattern is now `^T([0-9]+)(R?)\.` and the log path is `evidence/D%02d%s/tdd-log.md` from the number and the optional `R`, so `T5R.1` logs to `evidence/D05R/tdd-log.md` and every `T<n>.<m>` ID maps as before. The usage comment and the rejection message mention `T<n>R.<m>`. Each command was run from the repository root, while `evidence/D05R/tdd-log.md` did not exist, so nothing was appended anywhere.

1. `.claude/scripts/tdd.sh red T5R.1 x y`
   - Output: `no log at evidence/D05R/tdd-log.md: create it with its header note first`
   - Exit code: 2
2. `.claude/scripts/tdd.sh red T99.1 x y`
   - Output: `no log at evidence/D99/tdd-log.md: create it with its header note first`
   - Exit code: 2
3. `.claude/scripts/tdd.sh red T5X.1 x y` (malformed ID, still rejected)
   - Output: `task must look like T<n>.<m> or T<n>R.<m>, got: T5X.1`
   - Exit code: 2
